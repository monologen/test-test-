git
====> version controle system 
saving changes that have done to the multiple versions of the project
  
====>historial backups 


if u have a project and you want to do sm upgrades into it but u still want 
to have the original project u can press ctrel+shift+s u'll have two different 
copies of the project 

====> team based Development 

it allows to all the team to work on the same project in the same time
avioding all the changes that everyone's done to the project, after
everyone's finished they can mixed it up to main copy of the project 


====> comand line 
u can deal with git from the command line  

====> trunk based development 

now imagine with me a tree as the main code of the program, now we can consider
every change have been made any developer as a branch in the tree, we can cut 
that branch without effecting the tree, wich means that we can modify the code 
or the project as a personal layer without change anything in the main layer 
of it 
now what's "GITHUB" 

====> github is using git but in the clouding storage not on in your device 
contrarily of the concept of "git" u can use it on your local server 

now on github u can requst to merge u your own updated copy of the project to the 
main copy of the project so peaple can use it 

====> fork 
if your project is available to public everyone can make a copy of it and develop in it far away from 
the original copy  
====> projects test 
if u've been uploaded your project on github everyone can test the project and write down the problem they've 
been facing, so u or ur whole team can solve it ;)
